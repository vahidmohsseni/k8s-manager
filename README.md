# Container-Task Orchestrator

This software is consist of three main components based on the architecture that is illustrated below.

![System Design](/.github/images/design.png)

## Service Manager

The main component is `backend-service-manager` which has the features listed below.

- Handling the connection from `Executer`s
- Cheking the status of the connections
- Keeping the connections alive
- Storing an incoming task and its metadata in memory
- Assigning a task to a free `Executer`
- Replyig to requests from API server

## API Server

As the name hints, its main feature is to provide an interface for users to interact with _Service Manager_. Follow this [link](api/README.md) to find more about the API endpoints.

## Executer Node

This piece of software is the part of the node/container/machine on which you want that task to be run. It constantly communicates with _Service Manager_, sends its status, and waits for a task to be assigned by keeping the socket connection open to the server.
By decoupling this component from the _Service Manager_, we can scale out or in the runners according to the requirements of the load in the system. The time to wait for a runner to be up and running is eliminated by provisioning them before scheduling any tasks. Practically, we can add up as many runners as we need, and a single instance of the _Service Manager_ will handle the load.

# Docker images

For convenience, you can start the cloud containers with docker compose:

```shell
docker compose up --build -d
```

## Building individual containers

Build and run the API image

```shell
cd api
docker build -f Dockerfile -t k8s-manager-api .
docker run -p 5001:5001 --env HOST=0.0.0.0 -d k8s-manager-api

```

Build and run the service manager image

```shell
cd manager
docker build -f Dockerfile -t k8s-manager-service .
docker run -d k8s-manager-service
```

### Manual deployment

To run this system, follow the following instructions in order.

1. Service Manager

```shell
cd manager
python service.py
```

2. API Server

```shell
cd api
python app.py
```

3. Runners
   - It is possible to run multiple instances of this service on a same machine

```shell
cd worker
# Run on localhost
python service.py

# Connect to external host
python3 service.py -a <host address> -p <port>
```

3. API Server

```shell
cd api/
python app.py
```

# Development

This part is to help developers get on track.

## Python

```shell
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements depending on what you are working on
pip install -r <folder>/requirements.txt

```

## Pre-commit

```shell
# Add hooks for this repository
pre-commit install
```
